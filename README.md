## What is this?

This repository contains source code and other files which were, as far as anyone can tell, involved in the original production of release 79 of the Infocom game A Mind Forever Voyaging.

There are other public sources of this material available on the internet.

## What is it for?

Apart from the obvious historical and educational interest, I think it would be really good to know if a game file can still be built from the source code in this repository using Jesse McGrew's ZILF toolset.
